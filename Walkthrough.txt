AsyncAweight - An Exploratory Async/ Await Implementation
---------------------------------------------------------

Since C# 8 (-ish), "Task" has had no special meaning to the C# compiler, and all the 
implementation (except code-rewriting) should be able to be done in "userland" code.

This walkthrough was to see how far we could get! - and how much or little "magic" is 
involved!

The limitations I set out for the implementation:
  * Only value-returning operations were to be implemented
  * Cancellation/ CancellationToken were not to be considered.
  * Efficiency was not a large concern.

Each stage has been checked in as a separate commit; to see the evolution of the code,
restore the earliest revision and move forward one revision at a time.

1: First Stage - something that compiles!
-----------------------------------------

I started off with a pseudo "async main", with a call to a dummy method we'd like to run 
asynchronously.  The reason for not using the language's recently-provided "async main" 
functionality was to eliminate as much hidden logic (i.e. "magic"!) as possible.  The 
polling of "done" for completion is not pretty, and maybe I'll clean that up later.

From there, I implemented methods as the compiler complained about them not existing, 
until I had a program that compiled.  The syntax "await someOperation()" kicks off some
compile-time duck-typing by calling ".GetAwaiter()" on the result of someOperation().

In this experiment, "Tusk<T>" is the equivalent of "Task<T>" and "Aweighter<T>" is the 
result of calling "Tusk<T>.GetAwaiter()".
